# HTML/CSS/JS Weather App
API Based weather app

* Dynamically updates background image depending on current status (Rainy, cloudy, etc.)
* Grabs user's GeoLocation and uses Long/Lat to get weather for the area
* Uses an API connection to OpenWeatherMap to grab weather information
* Has a simple conversion for units (C/F)
* Mobile Responsive

This is a side project I used to familiarize myself with several aspects of web development when I first started programming. I have since gone back in and made this more mobile friendly and more streamlined than the original (Created about a year ago)

#### Important Note

This needs to be run on LocalHost for the API call to work. I used Python 3:
 > python -m http.server
